# Molagootal

Respected Trespasser,

This repository is an absolute abomination. So is its author. This repo was made as a test repo while learning how to make Python packages. This repo will persist if the author has enough guts to show off cringe stuff. She will regret not deleting this 10 years later. However this will be a start to much better Python packages in the future.

If you are still willing to waste your time, kindly test out this repo by installing the package.

```
!pip install molaguttal    //for Jupyter, Google Colab or Kaggle Notebook
```
```
pip install molaguttal  //for your CLI
```
Importing functions
```
from molaguttal import functions
from molaguttal import greet
```

Examples
```
greet.hey('Bucky Barnes')
functions.sum(3,2)
functions.avg(3,2)
functions.subtract(3,2)
```
This repo can be found at https://pypi.org/project/molaguttal/

This package was made as a joke. 
However if you still wish to reach out to me for further updates, feel free to contact me at - harshinivitdocs@gmail.com.
